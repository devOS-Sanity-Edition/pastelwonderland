## What is Pastel Wonderland?
Pastel Wonderland is a mod that uses pastel colors and feels to provide you with a beautiful, yet chaotic, dimension. All blocks are unique, and worldgen doesn't use any vanilla blocks (or is at least planned to not use any).

This mod is still in its early stages and in development, you can grab the latest archives from the actions tab, once that is set up. You're likely to encoutner many a bug and issues with certain things working or not.

This mod is required... I'd recommend downloading it.
